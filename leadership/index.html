                    <p>Part of being a successful leader is that you need to be
                    organised. Leading people is not something that happens by
                    accident. Rather, it is a planning for, and shaping a set of
                    desirable behaviours that create an environment where people
                    want to work and follow you as a leader. </p>

                                Being well organised is a key skill to effective
                                leadership. This is a skill that can be

                                can be put into place to further advance your
                                ability to be organised. Team members tend to
                                respond well to a leader who is well organised
                                and has "everything in place" as a structured
                                approach to completing a project, enables team

                                A leader who is forward-thinking is one who has
                                the ability to see beyond current challenges and
                                look into the future. Being forward thinking
                                enables you to have greater vision of the
                                potentials and possibilities for the future. It
                                also requires you to look for resolutions or

                                current trends. Forward thinking is also about
                                being open-minded to new possibilities, diverse
                                ideas and unconventional methods in your
                                approach to leading and managing.  </p>

                            <p>
                                An effective leader is one who builds
                                appropriate, positive relationships with those
                                she or he works with. The foundation of any good
                                working relationship is trust and transparency.
                                A leader who can be trusted to make the right
                                decisions at the right time and be transparent

                                Inspirational leadership is about seeing
                                yourself as a role model and as an example to
                                others.  You are the person who sets the
                                standards that your team follows.  A key
                                characteristic of being inspiring and motivating
                                others is to set high standards and expectations
                                and to be continuously encouraging of the team's
                                efforts. An inspirational leader is one who
                                creates enthusiasm, empowers others and instills
                                confidence in those they lead.  </p>

                                A knowledgeable leader is one who has depth and

                                and the project as a whole. A knowledgeable
