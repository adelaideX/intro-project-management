                In this situation you can proceed with the
                project as planned. Although you will take all of the necessary
                precautions while engaging in the project, the project
                environment (PESTLE) appears to be well known and risks
                understood. Ensure stakeholders are kept in the loop during
                execution.

                Review the risk categories in your PESTLE
                rating/score that have higher scores. These categories will
                point towards potential challenges and risks in executing your
                project. Try to identify ways to reduce or eliminate these risks
                before proceeding.  Communicate with stakeholders and your team
                to consider different approaches to respond to these risks.

                <h4>Higher risk project</h4>
                <p>
                If your project reflects a higher risk profile,
                it is often good idea to revisit your project idea/concept and
                explore alternative options by applying some critical and
                creative thinking techniques. In such a situation, take time to
                rethink your approach and then re-do the PESTLE profile. Before
                proceeding with your project, it is advisable that you take
                sufficient time to engage with your team and broader
                stakeholders to identify appropriate risk responses to reduce
                the likelihood and impact of these risks on your project during
                execution.

                <h4>High risk project</h4>
                <p>In a high-risk project, take a step back and consider
                all of the alternatives before making a decision to continue
                with the project. Should you decide to proceed, you will need to
                ensure that the identified high risks categories and items are
                adequately addressed and appropriate contingencies are in put
                into place. Such risks will require constant monitoring and
                review to ensure you remain on top of various mitigation
                actions.  Good communication with your project team and other
                stakeholders is essential.   Where the risk profile indicates an
                extremely high risk, one option might be to avoid the project
                entirely. Alternately, reconsider all of the planning and seek
                non-traditional approaches in order to consider the project in a
                different way, where risks might be better understood or where
                risks can be reduced - or for instance eliminated by
                transferring them to other parties (such as experienced
                contractors).
